    "- The number of inputs to the network is the number of columns in X_train.\n",
    "- Numbers of neurons for first, second, and third hidden layers are 10, 20, and 6, respectively.\n",

    "- Apply Dropout regularization with rate of 0.2 after each hidden layer.\n",
    "- Output layer has `sigmoid` activation function with one neuron (as it is a binary problem).\n",
    "- Use `adam` for optimizer, `binary_crossentropy` for loss, and `accuracy` for metrics.\n",
    "- Train the model with 100 epochs with a batch size of 128. Use a validation split of 30%. Balance the sample using the argument class_weight in your fit call (see [here](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/13490/how-to-set-class-weights-for-imbalanced-classes-in-keras) for help)\n",
